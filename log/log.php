    // - on accept
    //   - find accept call to unblock (do we need a fake ReplaySocket or abstraction?)
    //   - create session
    //   - start reader in log replay mode

    // - on msg
    //   - find session to unblock
    //   - unblock reader fiber
    // - on close
    //   - find session
    //   - close it
    //
    // then, after log has been replayed, we should have an up-to-date state,
    //   and an up-to-date set of sessions.
    // we can now upgrade these sessions to real sockets. then we can start
    //   the writer fiber. turn off log replay mode.
    // ðŸš€ FULL STEAM AHEAD!

    // thinking about this a bit more, we might be able to do this entirely
    //   at the io abstraction layer. instrument accept, read, write.
    //   if we get a ReplaySocket, we skip the event loop, we still suspend,
    //   but we will get resumed by the replayer instead of the event loop.
    // once replay is done do we upgrade the sockets in place.
    //   we can even signal the calls blocked on a fake operation that the
    //   socket upgrade happened via throw. each operation catches, extracts
    //   the real socket (maybe even from the exception itself), and then
    //   just falls back to its normal behaviour.

    // NOTE: we may need to add trailing \r\n when writing messages to
    // the fake socket on replay.
